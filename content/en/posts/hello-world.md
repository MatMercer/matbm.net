Hello World! For a developer, this is such a common thing to say when starting a new project.

Not only humans say hello, actually in SMTP protocol, it starts an e-mail exchange by sending `HELO`[^1].
So you can imagine that millions, if not billions of "Hello's" are sent everyday by machines.

I'm a developer that writes a lot of stuff in my daily basis, from documentation to random messages.
Creating a blog was something I was planning for a long time, but I never started it.

Well, today I started it!

# Ok... What is this blog about?

Some of the topics I want to cover:
* Developing
* Hacking, [not cracking!](http://www.catb.org/hacker-emblem/)
* Technics I use in my daily work
* Guides
* Cooking, you know, because I am a human and need to eat sometimes
* Random curiosities

# About the work behind this blog

You probably noticed that the logo is a cat, a weird parallel cat, well, it's my cat:

## The technology stack 

I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to render the blog and a fork of [Bootstrap theme by razonyang](https://github.com/razonyang/hugo-theme-bootstrap).

To edit the project, I use [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) behind [Windows subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
